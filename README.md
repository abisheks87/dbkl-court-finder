# DBKL Court Finder

A modern, real-time web application for discovering available sports courts across 72+ DBKL (Dewan Bandaraya Kuala Lumpur) facilities. Search by sport, location, date, and time — with distance-based sorting, consecutive slot filtering, and direct booking links.

## Features

### Multi-Sport Support

Browse availability for 11 sport categories:

- Badminton, Futsal, Football, Basketball, Volleyball, Tennis, Squash, Pickleball, Table Tennis, Sepak Takraw, Archery

### Smart Filtering

- **Consecutive Slots**: Filter courts by minimum consecutive available hours (1–12) within a configurable time window
- **Time Range**: Narrow results to a specific window (e.g. 6 PM – 10 PM) — consecutive slot count auto-syncs to match the range
- **Minimum Courts**: Require a minimum number of courts available at a venue before it shows up
- **Location Search**: Type-ahead search across all location names in the dropdown
- **Near Me**: Toggle to show only venues within 10 km of your current position (uses browser geolocation)

### Timeline View

- Visual grid of hourly slots (8 AM – 12 AM) for every court at each venue
- Color-coded: green = available, grey = booked
- Sticky venue column for easy reference while scrolling horizontally
- Venues sorted by distance from your location (nearest first)
- Stats bar showing total venues found, courts matching, and distance to nearest

### Booking Integration

- Hovering or tapping an available slot shows a tooltip with pricing (Malaysian Ringgit) and a direct link to the DBKL booking page

### Theme Support

- Light and dark mode with a toggle button
- Respects system preference on first visit (`prefers-color-scheme`)
- Theme persists across sessions via `localStorage`
- Anti-FOUC script in `index.html` applies the theme before first paint

### Responsive Design

- Adapts layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop using Tailwind breakpoints and a custom `useMediaQuery` hook
- Touch-friendly slot cells with `active:scale-95` feedback
- Date navigation with previous/next day buttons and formatted display

## Architecture

### State Management

All filter state (`sport`, `date`, `locationId`, `nearMeOnly`, `minConsecutiveSlots`, `minCourtsNeeded`, `timeRangeStart`, `timeRangeEnd`) is managed with `useState` in `App.tsx` and passed down as props. Filtering and sorting logic lives in `useMemo` hooks.

### Data Flow

1. **Locations load** — `useLocations` fetches all DBKL locations filtered by the selected sport category
2. **Batch fetch** — `useAllFacilities` fetches court data for all locations in batches of 10 with a 200ms inter-batch delay, reporting progress
3. **Geolocation** — `useUserLocation` gets the user's position; `useLocationDetails` fetches each venue's coordinates; `useGeocode` fills in missing coordinates via Nominatim
4. **Filter & sort** — `App.tsx` filters results by consecutive slots, time range, minimum courts, proximity, and selected location — then sorts by distance
5. **Render** — `TimelineView` displays the filtered venues with `CourtRow` and `SlotCell` components

### Caching Strategy

| Data                 | Cache Location                     | Lifetime              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Location list        | Module-level variable              | Session (no re-fetch) |
| Location coordinates | `localStorage`                     | Persistent            |
| Geocoding results    | `localStorage`                     | Persistent            |
| Court availability   | None (re-fetched on filter change) | Per request           |

## API Integration

The app consumes four DBKL public endpoints (no authentication required) and one external geocoding service:

### DBKL APIs

| Endpoint                                                                                              | Purpose                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /api/public/v1/location/getCategoryByLocation`                                                   | Fetch all locations and their sport categories    |
| `GET /api/public/v1/location/facility?sub_category={sport}&location_id={id}&search_date={YYYY-MM-DD}` | Court availability for a location on a given date |
| `GET /api/public/v1/location?id={id}`                                                                 | Location coordinates (latitude/longitude)         |
| `GET /api/public/v1/parliment?id={id}`                                                                | Parliament/constituency name for a location       |

Base URL: `https://apihub.dbkl.gov.my`

### Nominatim Geocoding (Fallback)

- **Endpoint**: `https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search`
- **Purpose**: Look up coordinates when DBKL returns invalid or missing lat/lng
- **Rate limit**: ~1 request/second (per Nominatim usage policy)

## Usage

1. **Select a sport** from the dropdown (defaults to Badminton)
2. **Pick a date** using the date picker or the previous/next day buttons
3. **Optionally filter by location** — type to search, or toggle "Near Me" to show only nearby venues
4. **Set time preferences** — choose a time range and/or minimum consecutive slots
5. **Set minimum courts** if you need multiple courts at the same venue
6. **Browse results** — venues are sorted by distance; scroll the timeline to see hourly availability
7. **Book** — hover or tap a green slot to see pricing and get a link to the DBKL booking page

## Performance

- **Batch loading**: Fetches 10 locations at a time with progress indicator to avoid overwhelming the API
- **Session caching**: Location list fetched once per session; coordinates cached in `localStorage`
- **No backend**: Entirely client-side — all data comes directly from DBKL's public API
- **Optimized re-renders**: Filtering and sorting use `useMemo`; callbacks use `useCallback`

## Browser Support

- Chrome / Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome for Android)

## CORS Note

The app calls DBKL APIs directly from the browser. If you encounter CORS errors in development, uncomment the proxy configuration in `vite.config.ts` to relay requests through the Vite dev server.
